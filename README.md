# This is a Machine Learning Internship Task 1 at TechnoHacks Edutech
Task : Fraud Transaction Detection

# About the Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

# Steps Performed in the Task :
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning and Data Preprocessing
3. Outliers Detection and Descriptive Statistical Analysis
4. Data Visualization (using matplotlib and seaborn )
5. Gathered Insights from analysis
6. Data Modelling
7. Selection of  Dependent and Independent Features and Train Test Split
8. Data Scaling
9. Building of Classification Model and Generating Prediction
10. As a result got Random Forest Classifier as the best model with 99 % Accuracy.
11. Save and load the best model
12. Generate Random Dataset with 20 points and generate prediction on sample data
13. Compare prediction of both dataset and as a outcome, came to know that most of the transactions are non-fraud transactions.

### This Project is good for Data Analysis and Predictive modeling Tasks.

### I would love If You give Star for My Performance.
